# rSharp (development version)

# rSharp 1.2.2

- rSharp now installs and loads even when a suitable .NET runtime is absent or cannot be initialised, instead of failing at load time. This covers both a missing runtime and an environment where a `dotnet` command is present but the native runtime host cannot be loaded (for example some build machines that ship the .NET SDK). The reason is reported when the package is attached and raised with an actionable message on the first call into .NET, which allows the package (and packages depending on it) to be built and checked in environments without a working .NET.
- The user guide vignette now renders on machines without a .NET runtime, showing its .NET examples without executing them, so the package builds where no runtime is available.
- Documentation examples that call into .NET now run only when a runtime is available, so `R CMD check` no longer errors on machines without .NET while the examples still run where a runtime is present.
- `dotnetAvailable()` is a new exported function that reports whether the .NET runtime is available, so code, examples, and vignettes can run .NET only when a runtime is present.

# rSharp 1.2.1

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fixed a crash and hang in parallel test suites caused by `R_ReleaseObject` being called from the .NET finalizer thread (#212).
- Fixed a `GCHandle` leak in the R to .NET argument-marshalling path that caused both the R and .NET heaps to grow with each call (#206).

# rSharp 1.2.0

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Declared `dotnet8` in the `SystemRequirements` field of `DESCRIPTION` (#177).
- Fixed package failing to load on R 4.6 with `undefined symbol: EXTPTR_PTR` by switching the C++ shim to the stable `R_ExternalPtrAddr()` API.
- Fixed macOS install-time segfault for users with multiple R versions installed in parallel by removing the versioned `R.framework` path baked into the shipped `.so`. The macOS link line now uses `-undefined dynamic_lookup` instead of `-lR`, matching the convention used by other R packages with C++ code.
- Arrays of .NET objects are now supported as arguments to methods. However, the signature of the .NET method must accept `Object[]` as parameter type.
- Fixed `object '.slotNames' not found` error when constructing S4 objects on runners where the `methods` package is not attached to the search path, by qualifying the lookup as `methods::.slotNames`.
